# Hook Generate

Builds one hook: an entry merged into the chosen scope for each supported tool, plus the backing script.

## Actions

| #   | Action         | Role                                              | Input             |
| --- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 01  | `capture-hook` | Clarify the moment, action, matcher, scope, tools | user request      |
| 02  | `write-hook`   | Merge the entry per tool, write the script         | the captured spec |
| 03  | `validate`     | Check the file, the merge, and the moment fit      | files written     |

Run the actions in order, `01 → 03`, and run each action's `## Test` before the next.
Before running an action, read its file in `actions/`, not only the table or assets.
