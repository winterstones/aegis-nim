# 06 -- Write Run Result

Emit a single `run-result.json` artifact summarising the observation from `05-delegate-sdlc`. The workflow's post-job (CI YAML) reads this file and performs the lifecycle effects: persist the audit log, finalize the Check Run, transition issue labels, post the completion marker. Splitting those side effects out of the agent keeps them deterministic, the agent only needs to write a file.

## Input
- `delegate_output` -- structured result from `05-delegate-sdlc`
- `run_record` -- merged data from `03-acquire-lock` and `05-delegate-sdlc`
- `config` -- parsed `.claude/aidd-orchestrator.json`

## Output
A single file at `$RUNNER_TEMP/run-result.json` (workflow-readable):

```json
{
  "run_id": "<id>",
  "started_at": "<ISO8601>",
  "ended_at": "<ISO8601>",
  "issue_number": 42,
  "outcome": "success | recovered | blocked",
  "pr_number": 117,
  "pr_url": "https://.../pull/117",
  "default_before": "<sha>",
  "default_after": "<sha>",
  "default_drift_shas": [],
  "current_branch": "<branch>",
  "recovery_applied": false,
  "pr_decoration_applied": true,
  "delegated_via_skill": true,
  "error": null
}
```


## Process

1. Merge `run_record` and `delegate_output` into the JSON shape above. Add `started_at` from `03-acquire-lock`, `ended_at = now (UTC)`.
2. Set `error` to a short string when `outcome = "blocked"`; otherwise `null`.
3. Write `$RUNNER_TEMP/run-result.json` (or `aidd_docs/async-runs/.pending/<run_id>.json` when running outside a GitHub Actions runner). The file is the sole hand-off contract between the Claude skill and the workflow's post-job.
4. Return the path to the caller. The agent may exit after this step; lifecycle effects happen post-Claude.

## Test

```bash
[ -s "$RUNNER_TEMP/run-result.json" ] && echo "OK file_exists" || echo "FAIL file_missing"

jq -e '.run_id and .outcome and (.outcome | IN("success","recovered","blocked"))' \
  "$RUNNER_TEMP/run-result.json" >/dev/null \
  && echo "OK shape_valid" || echo "FAIL shape_invalid"

# When outcome is success or recovered, a PR number is recorded.
jq -e 'if .outcome == "blocked" then true else (.pr_number | type == "number") end' \
  "$RUNNER_TEMP/run-result.json" >/dev/null \
  && echo "OK pr_recorded" || echo "FAIL pr_missing"
```
