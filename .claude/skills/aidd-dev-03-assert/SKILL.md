# Skill: assert

Validate that the work behaves as intended: run the project's assertions, iterating and fixing until they pass.

## Actions

| #   | Action                | Facet                                                       |
| --- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01  | `assert`              | Run the project's coding assertions, fixing until they pass |
| 02  | `assert-architecture` | Report where the code breaks the documented architecture    |
| 03  | `assert-frontend`     | Inspect the running UI, fixing until the behavior is right   |

Run every applicable facet by default, or one when named. Coding (`01`) always applies; add `03` when the work has a UI and a frontend is running, the facet resolving the URL itself; run `02` only when architecture conformance is asked for. Skip a facet whose precondition is absent, with a noted reason. Ask only when the intent is genuinely ambiguous.
Before running an action, read its file in `actions/`, not only the table or assets.

## Transversal rules

- Gate: it returns a pass or fail verdict on the work.
- Fix loop: the coding and frontend facets fix and re-run until they pass. The architecture facet only reports, never fixes.
- Stop only when every selected assertion passes a final clean sweep.

## Assets

- `assets/task-template.md`: the tracking file the frontend facet fills across its fix loop.
