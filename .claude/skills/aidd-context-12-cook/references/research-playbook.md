# Research playbook

Guidance for `03-research`: the angles to scout, the criteria each candidate must clear, and the verification each must pass. Define the target with `assets/research-goal-checklist.md` first, and clear `assets/research-checklist.md` before drafting.

## Angles to cover

Spawn one agent per angle so coverage stays wide:

- **Alternatives** — competing tools, libraries, or methods that could replace the current approach.
- **New methods** — techniques that emerged since the recipe was written.
- **Coverage gaps** — important sub-topics the recipe omits entirely. A masterclass that forgets a core feature has a gap.
- **Counter-intuitive wins** — surprising practices that beat the obvious default, with evidence of the result.
- **Deprecations** — what the recipe still recommends that is now discouraged or dead.

## Criteria for every candidate

- **Freshness** — prefer sources from the last 12 months. Record release or publish dates. Flag anything stale.
- **Community signal** — weigh what practitioners actually say: GitHub activity, open issues, Reddit, Hacker News, discussions. Separate real adoption from hype.
- **Tips and gotchas** — capture practical advice, common pitfalls, and migration notes worth keeping.
- **Credibility** — corroborate across sources. Trust official docs over a single blog post.

## Verify each candidate

After curating, confirm every surviving candidate before presenting it. Spawn one agent per candidate to check:

- **Exists** — confirm it is real and current, not invented or abandoned.
- **Official link** — capture the canonical source: official docs, repository, or release page.
- **Latest state** — record the current version or release date.
- **Real example** — prefer an image: grab the official screenshot or GIF that matches the action. Else a real output: copy it from the docs, or run the command and capture what it prints. For interactive output that cannot be scripted, mark it for the human to paste (ideally a screenshot). Never fabricate.
- Drop any candidate that cannot be confirmed against an official source.

## Reporting

- Return each candidate with its angle, level, value, and a source; verified ones carry an official link.
- Push for the most insights possible, then drop anything that neither beats nor extends the recipe.
- `03-research` sorts them into three buckets: alternatives (with pros/cons), coverage gaps, and counter-intuitive wins.
