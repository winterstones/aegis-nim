# 04 - Plan

Turn the explored source into a plan and its phases, save them, then review the whole before handoff. Never code.

## Input

The explore output from `02-explore` (projection, rules, feasibility, risks), plus any confirmed wireframe from `03-wireframe`.

## Output

A feature folder, always at `aidd_docs/tasks/<yyyy_mm>/<yyyy_mm_dd>_<feature-slug>/`, holding `plan.md` from [plan-template.md](../assets/plan-template.md) and one `phase-<n>.md` per phase from [phase-template.md](../assets/phase-template.md).

## Process

1. **Phases.** Break the work into phases, each a coherent unit of work that ships and verifies on its own, sized for one executor pass. Let the work decide how many.
2. **Folder.** Reuse the feature folder the source already lives in, or create one. When creating one and `01-gather`'s own source reference names a backlog item — a ticket id or URL, or a file path naming its Markdown artefact, never raw text — with no `backlog-link.json` there yet, declare it the same way `aidd-pm:04-spec` does:

   ```json
   {
     "backlog": "owner/repo#123",
     "written_at": "2026-08-21T09:00:00Z",
     "written_by": "aidd-dev:01-plan"
   }
   ```

   `backlog` is the one field, on whatever support the item lives - a forge reference or a project-relative Markdown path, never both. When the source names none, write nothing. When `backlog-link.json` already exists, leave it untouched - it is correctable by hand, and a later run must never overwrite a correction.
3. **Fill.** Fill the plan and each phase from their templates, following the inline contracts. Slice the projection across the phases.
4. **Show.** Display the written paths.
5. **Review.** Score the complete plan and its phases from 0 to 10, with ✓ reasons and ✗ risks. In interactive mode, show them and revise until approved. Under an autonomous orchestrator, revise against the source without waiting for approval; ask only when a product decision cannot be resolved from the source. The score is never written to the plan.

## Test

- `aidd_docs/tasks/<yyyy_mm>/<yyyy_mm_dd>_<feature-slug>/plan.md` exists with one `phase-<n>.md` per phase next to it.
- Every written file satisfies its template's inline contract.
- No `{...}` placeholder is left in any written file.
- The phase projection slices together cover the modify, create, and delete lists.
- A confidence score was reported and written to no file.
- An autonomous run waits only for a product decision that the source cannot resolve.
- A newly created folder whose source names a ticket carries a `backlog-link.json` naming it; reusing an existing folder never overwrites one already there.
