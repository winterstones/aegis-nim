# Agent Generate

Write one canonical agent from intent and render it per confirmed host tool, or once as a plugin source.

## Actions

| #   | Action          | Role                                           | Input        |
| --- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 01  | `capture-agent` | Gather the role, propose names, pick the model | user request |
| 02  | `write-agent`   | Render the agent per tool and write            | the role     |
| 03  | `validate`      | Check each agent file                          | the files    |

Run the actions in order, `01 → 03`, and run each action's `## Test` before the next.
Before running an action, read its file in `actions/`, not only the table or assets.
