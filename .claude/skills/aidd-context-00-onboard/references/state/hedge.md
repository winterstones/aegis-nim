# Plan-status hedge

The plan's `status:` frontmatter refines the build-to-ship pin, so review is never skipped nor premature.

| Plan `status:`               | Pin                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |

| `blocked`                    | surface the blocker, not a normal pin |
| the field is missing or unreadable | surface the plan as broken, not a normal pin |
