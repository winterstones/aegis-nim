# Project Memory

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  new([no argument, or setup]) --> scan --> write --> sync --> wired([memory wired])
  update([refresh]) --> scan --> check --> write
  rewire([rewire]) --> sync
  scan -.-> empty([nothing to remember])
```

## Actions

Run the flow above, reading only the next action file.

| Action | Does                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| scan   | read the project                |
| write  | write the memory                |
| check  | show what drifted, change nothing |
| sync   | pick the tools, wire it in      |

## Transversal rules

- If a referenced file cannot be read, stop and say so. Never invent its content.
- Ask before anything ambiguous. Never default silently.
- A bank that already exists changes only through what the user approved, file by file and line by line.
- End with a short report of what changed.
