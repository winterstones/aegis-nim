| Action    | Does                                             |

| assess    | apply one requested lens to an Epic or Story     |
| reconcile | reconcile three independent, caller-supplied reports |

## Transversal rules

- Run one route per invocation.
- Never spawn, delegate, persist, or mutate.
- Treat roles as analytical lenses, not human authorities.
- Ground every finding and question in cited evidence; never invent a decision.
- Return proposals only; the caller decides what to do with them.
