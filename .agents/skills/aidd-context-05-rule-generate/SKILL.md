# Rule Generate

Write one canonical rule from intent and render it per confirmed host tool that supports rules, or once as a plugin source.

## Actions

| #   | Action         | Role                                      | Input        |
| --- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 01  | `capture-rule` | Capture the topic, pick category and slug | user request |
| 02  | `write-rule`   | Write the rule file per supported tool    | the topic    |
| 03  | `validate`     | Check each rule file                      | the files    |

Run the actions in order, `01 → 03`, and run each action's `## Test` before the next.
Before running an action, read its file in `actions/`, not only the table or assets.
