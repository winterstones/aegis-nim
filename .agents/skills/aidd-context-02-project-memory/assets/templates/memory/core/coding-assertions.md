# Coding Assertions

The checks that must pass for code to count as done. Minimal, run after every change.

## Before commit

The fast gate.

| Order | Command     | Checks           |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 1     | `<command>` | <e.g. typecheck> |

## Before push

The heavier gate.

| Order | Command     | Checks              |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| 1     | `<command>` | <e.g. tests, build> |

## Behavior

I fix is needed, spawn 1 agent per assertion to fix (e.g typechecking / tests / rules violated on category UI = 3 agents).
