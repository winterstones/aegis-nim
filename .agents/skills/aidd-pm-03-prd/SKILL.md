  source([feature description, optionally with user stories]) --> draft --> finalize --> done([saved PRD])
```

## Actions

Run the flow above. Read only the next action file.

| Action   | Does                                 |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| draft    | draft per template, iterate to approval |
| finalize | save the approved draft                |

## Transversal rules

- Keep product and lifecycle decisions with the user.
- Separate evidence, decisions, and assumptions.
- Preserve source links and existing edits.
- Ask natural questions; never expose actions, references, or unchanged state.
- Require explicit approval or caller-provided bounded authority before any write.
- State what and why; never a technical plan or user stories.
