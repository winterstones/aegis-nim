# 01 -- Detect Context

Inspects the current repo and the active runtime to confirm preconditions.

## Input
- `cwd` (required) -- string, absolute path of the target repo

## Output
```json
{
  "repo_root": "/abs/path",
  "platform": "github",
  "remote_owner": "org",
  "remote_repo": "name",
  "default_branch": "main",
  "sdlc_capability_present": true
}
```

## Process

1. Resolve repo root via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.
2. Read `git remote get-url origin`, parse owner/repo, set `platform = "github"`. v1 supports GitHub only; abort with a clear message if the remote points elsewhere.
3. Read `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` to get the default branch.
4. Discover an SDLC orchestration capability by listing loaded skills and matching their `description` for keywords such as `SDLC orchestrator`, `plan, implement, test, review, commit, PR`, or `software development lifecycle`. Set `sdlc_capability_present` accordingly. Do not match by hardcoded skill name.
5. Emit the JSON above.

## Test

Run the action against a known GitHub repo with an SDLC-advertising skill loaded: `repo_root` exists, `remote_owner`/`remote_repo` match `gh repo view --json owner,name`, and `sdlc_capability_present` is `true`. Disable that skill and re-run: `sdlc_capability_present` is `false`.
