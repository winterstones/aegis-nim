# Skill: plan

Turn a gathered source into an implementation plan and its phase files. Never writes code.

## Actions

| #   | Action      | Role                                                 | Input                      |
| --- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 01  | `gather`    | Collect and restate the source                       | user request               |
| 02  | `explore`   | Read the codebase for projection, rules, feasibility | gathered source            |
| 03  | `wireframe` | Sketch a screen at low fidelity, frontend only       | source + explore context   |
| 04  | `plan`      | Break into phases, write the plan and phase files    | explore output + wireframe |

Run them in order, `01 → 04`. The plan is the culmination. Skip `03` when there is no UI.
Before running an action, read its file in `actions/`, not only the table or assets.

Once the plan and its phase files are written, and only then, run:

```shell
echo "aidd:step-end aidd-dev:01-plan"
```

This is the one thing about a step nothing else can supply. No host reports when a skill's
work finished — a skill call's own result comes back in a tenth of a second, which is the
dispatch, not the completion — so a measurement that never hears this ends the step at the
next pause and credits planning with one turn out of however many it took. The framework
repository documents the run journal this writes into, in `aidd_docs/runs/README.md`.
