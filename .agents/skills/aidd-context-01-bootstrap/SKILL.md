# Bootstrap

Plays the role of technical architect for a new SaaS project. Walks the user through a 24-item checklist (18 user-input + 6 derived), proposes 2-3 candidate stacks, audits each via parallel agents, then produces `aidd_docs/INSTALL.md` capturing the technical vision, decisions, stack, architecture pattern, folder tree, and install steps. Documentation only: no code, no scaffolding.

## Actions

| #   | Action                | Role                                                           | Input              |
| --- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 01  | `gather-needs`        | Q&A across the 24-item checklist                               | user intent        |
| 02  | `propose-candidates`  | Derive 2-3 candidate stacks, render comparison table           | filled checklist   |
| 03  | `audit-candidates`    | Spawn parallel agents to validate each candidate, emit verdict | candidates table   |
| 04  | `pick-and-design`     | User picks winner; generate folder tree + Mermaid diagram      | audit report       |
| 05  | `write-install-md`    | Produce `aidd_docs/INSTALL.md`                                 | design + decisions |

Run `01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05`. The audit (03) gates: if every candidate fails, loop back to 02 or 01.
Before running an action, read its file in `actions/`, not only the table or assets.

## Transversal rules

- **No file scaffolding.** This skill writes only `aidd_docs/INSTALL.md`. It never creates `package.json`, source files, or empty directories.
- **Anti-sycophancy.** When the user expresses a stack preference that conflicts with their needs (e.g. wants Mongo for heavily relational data), challenge it before accepting: surface audit concerns and ask whether the user has a mitigation plan.
- **Recommend opinionated, not encyclopedic.** Each action proposes 2-3 options max, never a long catalog. The user should leave with a concrete decision, not a research paper.
- **Stop on full checklist.** Action 01 keeps asking until the 18 user-input items (blocks 1-3) are filled; the 6 derived items (block 4) are filled across actions 02 and 04.
- **Apply heuristics from `references/stack-heuristics.md`** when proposing candidates.
